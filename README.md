## Inspiration

Currently, when you go to donate blood you the staff checking you in must flip through a physical book of medications to check if the medications you are on the restricted medication list for donating. We thought this process was outdated and could be streamlined by digitizing the checking of medications. Doing this allows for donors to be checked in faster and reduces the workload on staff at the blood clinics. Additionally, we wanted to inspire people to donate by sharing relevant blood donation stats and wanted to make eligibility checking easier for all. We have done this by creating a form where potential donors can answer a few questions and instantly see if they are eligible to donate. Potential donors can also check the medications they are on to see if they are on the restricted medications list.
## What it does

Streamlines the process for checking blood donation eligibility.
## How we built it

The website was built with React.
## Challenges we ran into

We had challenges visualizing the stats with React but we did our research and we were able to overcome this challenge.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to build the website in 24 hours and have it include the features we wanted.
## What we learned

We built the website entirely with React.js which not everyone on our team knew. Additionally, we were able to learn the motivators for people to donate blood and explored some of the reasons why people do not donate (time, unsure if they are eligible, lack of awareness).
## What's next for HemoHub

In the future, we would like to include a chatbot that can answer FAQ about donating blood.
